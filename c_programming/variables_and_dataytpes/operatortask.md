**Task Instructions:**

1. Inside your "Tasks" directory, create a file named "arithmetic.c" for this task.

**Problem Statement:**

After today's class on arithmetic operators in C, your task is to implement a program that demonstrates the use of these operators in a practical context.

**Requirements:**

1. The program should declare and initialize two variables with numeric values of your choice.

2. Utilize each of the following arithmetic operators to perform operations on these variables:
   - Addition (`+`)
   - Subtraction (`-`)
   - Multiplication (`*`)
   - Division (`/`)
   - Modulus (`%`)

3. Print the result of each operation along with a meaningful label.

4. Include comments in your code to explain the purpose of each operation.

**Example Output:**

```c
#include <stdio.h>

int main() {
    // Declare and initialize two variables
    int num1 = 10;
    int num2 = 5;

    // Perform addition
    printf("Addition: %d\n", num1 + num2);

    // Perform subtraction
    printf("Subtraction: %d\n", num1 - num2);

    // Perform multiplication
    printf("Multiplication: %d\n", num1 * num2);

    // Perform division
    printf("Division: %d\n", num1 / num2);

    // Perform modulus
    printf("Modulus: %d\n", num1 % num2);

    return 0;
}
```

**Task Clarification:**

This task aims to reinforce the understanding of arithmetic operators in C and their practical application. Ensure to provide clear comments in your code, explaining the purpose of each operation.
