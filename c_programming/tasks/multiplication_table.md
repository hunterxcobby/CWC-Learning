**Task Instructions:**

1. Inside your "Tasks" directory, create a file named "multiplication_table.c" for this task.

**Problem Statement:**

Building on the concept of `for` loops, your task is to create a program that generates and prints the multiplication table for a given number.

**Requirements:**

1. Prompt the user to enter a number for which they want to generate the multiplication table.

2. Implement a `for` loop to calculate and print the multiplication table for numbers 1 through 10 for the user-provided input.

3. Ensure clear formatting of the output, presenting the multiplication table in a readable format.

4. Include comments in your code to explain the purpose of the loop and any relevant calculations.

5. Enhance your program by allowing the user to generate multiplication tables for multiple numbers in a single run. After presenting the table for one number, prompt the user if they want to generate another table. If yes, repeat the process; if no, exit the program.

**Example Input and Expected Output:**

```plaintext
Enter a number to generate its multiplication table: 7

Multiplication Table for 7:
7 x 1 = 7
7 x 2 = 14
7 x 3 = 21
7 x 4 = 28
7 x 5 = 35
7 x 6 = 42
7 x 7 = 49
7 x 8 = 56
7 x 9 = 63
7 x 10 = 70

Generate another multiplication table? (1 for Yes, 0 for No): 1

Enter a number to generate its multiplication table: 4

Multiplication Table for 4:
4 x 1 = 4
4 x 2 = 8
4 x 3 = 12
4 x 4 = 16
4 x 5 = 20
4 x 6 = 24
4 x 7 = 28
4 x 8 = 32
4 x 9 = 36
4 x 10 = 40

Generate another multiplication table? (1 for Yes, 0 for No): 0
```

**Task Clarification:**

This task aims to evaluate your understanding of `for` loops by creating a program that dynamically generates multiplication tables based on user input. Ensure your code is well-commented, providing clear explanations for the loop structure and any relevant calculations.
